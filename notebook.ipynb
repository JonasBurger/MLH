    "<li type=\"square\">As the data information said it will be better to drop the duration column since duration is highly correlated in whether a potential client will buy a term deposit. Also, <b>duration is obtained after the call is made to the potential client</b> so if the target client has never received calls this feature is not that useful. The reason why duration is highly correlated with opening a term deposit  is because the more the bank talks to a target client the higher the probability the target client will open a term deposit since a higher duration means a higher interest (commitment) from the potential client. </li><br>\n",
